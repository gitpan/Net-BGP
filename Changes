Revision history for Perl extension Net::BGP.

0.03  Sun Mar 16 13:31:55 2003
	- Added clone() method to Net::BGP::Update

	- Removed warning when encoding empty AS_PATH which is
		ok for IBGP peering sessions.

	- Removed warnings for missing mandatory path attributes
		for the case when no NLRI is present in an
		UPDATE message.

	- Fixed bug in _encode_prefix() in Net::BGP::Update
		which could cause 0.0.0.0/0 to be encoded into
		the prefix list when prefixes shorter than 32
		bits (i.e. non-host routes) are specified with
		all 4 octets (e.g. when 192.168/16 is given as
		192.168.0.0/16).

	Thanks to Martin Lorensen for identifying these problems.

0.02  Sun Jan 26 16:32:15 2003
	- Fixed symbolic method call syntax in _handle_event()
		which is not recognized prior to perl 5.6.0.

0.01  Fri Sep  6 16:09:32 2002
