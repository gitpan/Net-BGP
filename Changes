	  on behalf of the Stephen Scheck.

	- Added code to configure and later remove a dummy $SIG{PIPE}
	  handler if note is set to avoid a peer reset causes the server
	  to stop.

	- Split Update into Update and NLRI with is-a relation as
	  preperation for a RIB/Router module.

	- Split Peer into Peer and Transport with has-a relation
	  to resolve the old issue of cloned peer objects.

	- Fixed Process to handle peers with same IP local and/or remote.

	- Fixed a rare raise condision if a peer connected while outside
	  the Select statement

	- Added support for optional parameters and optional capabilities.

	- Added support for REFRESH messages.

	- Added refresh_callback which are called on new sessions and
	  when a REFRESH message is recieved.

	- Added reset_callback which are called on connection reset of
	  any kind.

	- Added "renew" constructor to Peer objects to reclaim an object
	  reference from the string representation of the same - Using
	  weak references (Scalar::Util).

	- Fixed SO_REUSEADDR - should be done BEFORE bind()

	- Added a simple asstring method for the Peer object. NOTE: Format
	  may change in the future!

	- Some methods in Peer (and Transport) maid public.

	- Added an ASPath object to handle complex ASPaths, including
	  confederations.

	- The new NLRI object is overloaded and has many new methods
	  compared to the potion of code moved from Update

	- A fairly large test suite added.

	- The RIB.pm placeholder has been removed. This functionality
	  will be implemented in a different module soon.

0.03  Sun Mar 16 13:31:55 2003
	- Added clone() method to Net::BGP::Update

	- Removed warning when encoding empty AS_PATH which is
		ok for IBGP peering sessions.

	- Removed warnings for missing mandatory path attributes
		for the case when no NLRI is present in an
		UPDATE message.

	- Fixed bug in _encode_prefix() in Net::BGP::Update
		which could cause 0.0.0.0/0 to be encoded into
		the prefix list when prefixes shorter than 32
		bits (i.e. non-host routes) are specified with
		all 4 octets (e.g. when 192.168/16 is given as
		192.168.0.0/16).

	Thanks to Martin Lorensen for identifying these problems.

0.02  Sun Jan 26 16:32:15 2003
